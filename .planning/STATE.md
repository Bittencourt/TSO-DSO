# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-18)

**Core value:** A researcher expresses a scenario and model variant declaratively, runs it end-to-end with an open-source solver, and gets trustworthy, reproducible results and prices — every assumption documented, every layer swappable.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — distribution-pricing-dadp-dlmp-decomposition

## Current Position

Phase: 05 (distribution-pricing-dadp-dlmp-decomposition) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 05
Last activity: 2026-07-19 -- Phase 05 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Abstraction ladder rungs 0-5 map directly to phases; each phase is a runnable/validated end-to-end solve at increasing fidelity (mvp mode).
- Roadmap: Centralized SOCP (Phase 4) is the ground truth ADMM (Phases 6-7) is validated against; pricing (Phase 5) sits between to de-risk duals early.
- Roadmap: `operational_oracle(z)→(cost,π)` seam + SEAM-01 stubs land at the SOCP correctness milestone (Phase 4) so the deferred planning layer is additive, not a rewrite.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: ~~Re-verify Clarabel API specifics~~ RESOLVED (Phase-4 research, 2026-07-18): RotatedSecondOrderCone form `[0.5l, v, P, Q] in RotatedSecondOrderCone()`, Clarabel handles SOCP+quadratic natively, `Parameter` API confirmed, Clarabel copy_to-only (no direct_model). No factory change needed.
- [Phase 7]: Adaptive-ρ / dual-residual tuning on the SOCP subproblem is partial-research; may warrant `--research-phase`.
- [Phase 4 follow-up — welfare gap]: The IEEE-13 ground-truth solve reproduces the thesis VOLTAGE well (v₉[16]=1.0436 vs 1.0493, 0.5%; A1 confirmed = |V| magnitude, node 9=struct index 10) but the WELFARE (−4823) differs from the thesis +$1819 because the MEM price / temperature profiles / house-counts are figure-bound (not recoverable from the thesis figures). A COMPUTED GOLDEN is pinned as the regression anchor (accepted by researcher 2026-07-18). TODO (later reconciliation pass): digitize thesis figures ~4.2/4.5 to recover the exact MEM/load/PV inputs and close the welfare gap; then re-pin the golden and tighten the thesis cross-check.
